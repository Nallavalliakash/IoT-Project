This project introduces an innovative approach to wheelchair control by integrating a MicroElectro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometer into the system. The MEMS accelerometer serves as a key component, allowing users to manipulate the wheelchair's movement through subtle hand gestures. The project focuses on developing a responsive and intuitive control mechanism that enhances mobility for individuals with physical disabilities.
